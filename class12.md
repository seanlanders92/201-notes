### Reading 12

#### Chart.js
> - At first sight a <canvas> looks like the <img> element, with the only clear difference being that it doesn't have the src and alt attributes. Indeed, the <canvas> element has only two attributes, width and height. These are both optional and can also be set using DOM properties. When no width and height attributes are specified, the canvas will initially be 300 pixels wide and 150 pixels high. The element can be sized arbitrarily by CSS, but during rendering the image is scaled to fit its layout size: if the CSS sizing doesn't respect the ratio of the initial canvas, it will appear distorted.

> - Providing fallback content is very straightforward: just insert the alternate content inside the <canvas> element. Browsers that don't support <canvas> will ignore the container and render the fallback content inside it. Browsers that do support <canvas> will ignore the content inside the container, and just render the canvas normally.

> - Before we can start drawing, we need to talk about the canvas grid or coordinate space. Our HTML skeleton from the previous page had a canvas element 150 pixels wide and 150 pixels high. To the right, you see this canvas with the default grid overlayed. Normally 1 unit in the grid corresponds to 1 pixel on the canvas. The origin of this grid is positioned in the top left corner at coordinate (0,0). All elements are placed relative to this origin. So the position of the top left corner of the blue square becomes x pixels from the left and y pixels from the top, at coordinate (x,y). Later in this tutorial we'll see how we can translate the origin to a different position, rotate the grid and even scale it, but for now we'll stick to the default.

> - Unlike SVG, <canvas> only supports two primitive shapes: rectangles and paths (lists of points connected by lines). All other shapes must be created by combining one or more paths. Luckily, we have an assortment of path drawing functions which make it possible to compose very complex shapes. First let's look at the rectangle. There are three functions that draw rectangles on the canvas:
> fillRect(x, y, width, height)
> Draws a filled rectangle.
> strokeRect(x, y, width, height)
> Draws a rectangular outline.
> clearRect(x, y, width, height)
> Clears the specified rectangular area, making it fully transparent.
> Each of these three functions takes the same parameters. x and y specify the position on the canvas (relative to the origin)
> of the top-left corner of the rectangle. width and height provide the rectangle's size.


>Up until now we have only seen methods of the drawing context. If we want to apply colors to a shape, there are two important properties we can use: fillStyle and strokeStyle.

fillStyle = color
Sets the style used when filling shapes.
strokeStyle = color
Sets the style for shapes' outlines.
color is a string representing a CSS <color>, a gradient object, or a pattern object. We'll look at gradient and pattern objects later. By default, the stroke and fill color are set to black (CSS color value #000000).
