### Reading 09

#### Chapter 7 Forms.

> - ```Form controls live inside a <form> element. This element should always carry the action attribute and will usually have a method and id attribute too.```
> - ```Every <form> element requires an action attribute. Its value is the URL for the page on the server that will receive the information in the form when it is submitted.```
> - With the get method, the values from the form are added to the end of the URL specified in the action attribute. The get method is ideal for:
> - ● short forms (such as search boxes)
> - ● when you are just retrieving data from the web server (not sending information that should be added to or deleted from a database)
> - maxlength You can use the maxlength attribute to limit the number of characters a user may enter into the text field. Its value is the number of characters they may enter. For example, if you were asking for a year, the maxlength attribute could have a value of 4.
> - ```The <textarea> element``` is used to create a mutli-line text input. Unlike other input elements this is not an empty element. It should therefore have an opening and a closing tag.
> - type="radio" Radio buttons allow users to pick just one of a number of options.

#### Chapter 14

> - The border-spacing property allows you to control the distance between adjacent cells. By default, browsers often leave a small gap between each table cell, so if you want to increase or decrease this space then the border-spacing property allows you to control the gap.
> - The cursor property allows you to control the type of mouse cursor that should be displayed to users.
