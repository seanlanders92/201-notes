### Reading 07
#### HTML chapter 6
> - The <table> element is used to create a table. The contents of the table are written out row by row.

> - <tr> You indicate the start of each row using the opening <tr> tag. (The tr stands for table row.)

> - It is followed by one or more <td> elements (one for each cell in that row). At the end of the row you use a closing </tr> tag.

> - <td> Each cell of a table is represented using a <td> element. (The td stands for table data.) At the end of each cell you use a closing </td> tag.

> - The <th> element is used just like the <td> element but its purpose is to represent the heading for either a column or a row. (The th stands for table heading.) Even if a cell has no content, you should still use a <td> or <th> element to represent the presence of an empty cell otherwise the table will not render correctly. (The first cell in the first row of this example shows an empty cell.)

> - The colspan attribute can be used on a <th> or <td> element and indicates how many columns that cell should run across.

> - The rowspan attribute can be used on a <th> or <td> element to indicate how many rows a cell should span down the table.
