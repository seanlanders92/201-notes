#### Chapter 9 Flash
> - Flash is a popular tool used for creating video animation as well as playing audio.


#### Chapter 16 Images
> - You can control the size of an image using the width and height properties in CSS, just like you can for any other box. Specifying image sizes helps pages to load more smoothly because the HTML and CSS code will often load before the images, and telling the browser how much space to leave for an image allows it to render the rest of the page without waiting for the image to download.

> - By default, images are inline elements. This means that they flow within the surrounding text. In order to center an image, it should be turned into a block- level element using the display property with a value of block. Once it has been made into a block-level element, there are two common ways in which you can horizontally center an image: 1: On the containing element, you can use the text-align property with a value of center. 2: On the image itself, you can use the use the margin property and set the values of the left and right margins to auto.

> - The background-image property allows you to place an image behind any HTML element. This could be the entire page or just part of the page. By default, a background image will repeat to fill the entire box. The path to the image follows the letters url, and it is put inside parentheses and quotes.

> - When an image is not being repeated, you can use the background-position property to specify where in the browser window the background image should be placed. This property usually has a pair of values. The first represents the horizontal position and the second represents the vertical.


#### Chapter 19 Practical Information
> - Search engine optimization (or SEO) is the practice of trying to help your site appear nearer the top of search engine results when people look for the topics that your website covers. At the heart of SEO is the idea of working out which terms people are likely to enter into a search engine to find your site and then using these terms in the right places on your site to increase the chances that search engines will show a link to your site in their results.

> - On-page techniques are the methods you can use on your web pages to improve their rating in search engines. The main component of this is looking at keywords that people are likely to enter into a search engine if they wanted to find your site, and then including these in the text and HTML code for your site in order to help the search engines know that your site covers these topics.

> - Getting other sites to link to you is just as important as on-page techniques. Search engines help determine how to rank your site by looking at the number of other sites that link to yours. They are particularly interested in sites whose content is related to yours. For example, if you were running a website that sold fish bait, then a link from a hairdresser is not likely to be considered as relevant as one from an angling community.

> - The Google Analytics service relies on you signing up for an account at: www.google.com/analytics The site will give you a piece of tracking code which you need to put on every page of your site.

> - hoW it Works
> - Every time someone loads a page of your site, the tracking code sends data to the Google servers where it is stored. Google then provides a web- based interface that allows you to see how visitors use your site.
> - the tracking code
> - A tracking code is provided by Google Analytics for each website you are tracking. It should appear just before the closing head tag. The code does not alter the appearance of your web pages.

> - As the name suggests, File Transfer Protocol (or FTP) allows you to transfer files across the Internet from your computer to the web server hosting your site. There are many FTP programs that offer a simple interface that shows you the files on your computer alongside the files that are on your web server. These allow you to drag and drop files from your computer to the server or vice versa.
