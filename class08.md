#### Layouts

> - CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.
> - If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is known as the containing or parent element.
> - CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control the layout of a page: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute positioning. You specify the positioning scheme using the position property in CSS. You can also float elements using the float property.
> - If you want to control which element sits on top, you can use the z-index property. Its value is a number, and the higher the number the closer that element is to the front. For example, an element with a z-index of 10 will appear over the top of one with a z-index of 5.
